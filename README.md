SmartQuery AI - Insurance Query Assistant
SmartQuery AI is an intelligent web application that helps users understand their insurance policy coverage by asking natural language queries. The system extracts relevant clauses from insurance documents using a semantic similarity model and provides structured answers including decision, claim amount, justification, and matched clauses.

How It Works
User submits a query (optionally uploading a policy PDF).

The system extracts clauses from the uploaded document or from a predefined dataset.

The query is semantically compared to the clauses using Sentence-BERT.

The system identifies top relevant clauses and provides:

Approval decision

Claim amount

Justification (based on clause content and score)

Matched clause(s)

The query is stored and displayed in the userâ€™s history.
